## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS modules
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - preprocessor scripting language for css
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - local development server

### Why with React

Beacuse maybe in the future the app needs to add others pages, add functnalties, in thats case it will be easier to do it with a library that can handle complex problems easier than vanila javascript.

### What I learned

I started this challnge to imporve my skills in styling and learn Sass <br />

Sass have a relly cool way to write css, for example: you don't need to write the parent class when selcting a specific element in the dom, you can just nested it in the class. <br />

css

```css
.classDemo {
  color: red;
}
.classDemo a {
  color: blue;
}
```

scss

```scss
.classDemo {
  color: red;
  a {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```
